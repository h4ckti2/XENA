Message broker powered Adonis.ts and TypeScript. Before you ask, I know, maybe a preexisting solution for message distribution would be a better choice, but I argue that this use case is very domain specific. Iâ€™ve went with Postgres as the storage solution, but you can easily install different SQL drivers in the Adonis framework and go with your favorite database engine. SQL driver installation process is a piece of cake. Adonis provides support for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, MariaDB and SQLite out of the box.
